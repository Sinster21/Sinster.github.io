##Making  a static website

This page is used as a testing site for different kinds of codes that you can use in a website, like JavaScript, CSS, HTML and some JQuery. Hope you have fun exploring the different types of effects that comes with coding.

When stuck on a error or problem, I used  w3schools tutorials and the how to's in making something cool,  while stackflow help me on issuses I had with the code or if it didnt work.
